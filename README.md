### Navigating the repo
* The Jupyter notebook file **pt1_mars_news** scrapes Mars news info from *https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html* & creates a list of dictionaries of these news titles & their corresponding preview blurbs.
* The Jupyter notebook file **pt2_mars_weather** scrapes Mars weather data from *https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html* then cleans & analyzes that data. The *Output* folder contains the cleaned data, a summary of that data, and images of plots created during the analysis process.
